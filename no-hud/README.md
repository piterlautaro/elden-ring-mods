# ShaderToggler Advanced

ShaderToggler Advanced is a ReShade 5.1+ add-on for toggling **game shaders** on and off in groups with a single hotkey.  
It is designed for **game shaders only**, not ReShade effects.

Originally created by **Frans "Otis_Inf" Bouma**.  
Modified and expanded by **Sven "Gametism" Königsmann**.

This version adds:
- a modernized UI  
- active-at-startup support for x86  
- group duplication  
- group reordering  
- improved hotkey handling  
- accelerated shader browsing while holding keys  
- controller button support  
- **hold-based activation modes**  
- **auto-hide (timed) toggle groups**
- **inverted auto-hide behavior**
- **multiple timed trigger keys with configurable trigger modes**

---

## How to use

Place `ShaderToggler.addon64` or `ShaderToggler.addon` in the same folder as the **game executable**.  
In most cases, this is also the folder where the ReShade DLL is located.

For **Vulkan** games, the ReShade DLL may be located elsewhere depending on the setup.

For some **Unreal Engine** games, there may be two executables:
- one in the root game folder
- one deeper inside a path like  
  `GameName\Binaries\Win64\GameName-Win64-Shipping.exe`

In those cases, ShaderToggler has to be placed in the **actual executable folder**, for example:

`GameName\Binaries\Win64`

ReShade must also be installed in that same folder.

Make sure you are using the **ReShade version with Add-on support**.

When the game starts, open the ReShade overlay and go to the **Add-ons** tab.  
You should see the **Shader Toggler** panel and its controls there.

---

## Creating a toggle group

To create a new shader toggle group:

1. Open the ReShade overlay  
2. Go to the **Shader Toggler** section  
3. Click **New**

A new group is created with:
- the default name `Default`
- the default hotkey `Caps Lock`

To change these:
- click **Edit**
- rename the group
- assign a different hotkey

Hotkeys do **not** need to be unique.  
Group names also do **not** need to be unique.

A hotkey can be:
- a keyboard key  
- a mouse button  
- a supported controller button  
- optionally combined with `Alt`, `Ctrl`, or `Shift` for keyboard bindings  

Each group can also be set to:
- **Active at startup**
- **Hold mode**
- **Auto-hide mode (timed)**

You can also:
- duplicate groups  
- reorder groups with drag and drop  
- save all groups to the config file  

---

## Activation modes

ShaderToggler Advanced supports three main ways to control a group:

### 1. Toggle mode (default)
- Press key → ON  
- Press again → OFF  

This is the classic behavior.

**Example:**  
You want to manually hide a minimap:
- press key once → minimap disappears  
- press again → minimap returns  

---

### 2. Hold mode
- Group is active **only while holding the key**

Optional:
- **Invert hold** → active by default, turns OFF while holding

This is useful for:
- ADS overlays  
- temporary HUD visibility  
- quick comparison setups  

**Example (normal hold):**
- hold key → scoped overlay hidden  
- release key → scoped overlay returns  

**Example (invert hold):**
- overlay is normally hidden  
- hold key → overlay becomes visible only while held  

---

### 3. Auto-hide mode (Timed Mode)
Timed mode temporarily changes a group state when one of its trigger keys is used.

You can configure:
- **Hide delay / show time**
- **Minimum visible time**
- **Fade-out linger**
- **Invert auto-hide behavior**
- **multiple trigger keys**
- **trigger mode per trigger key**

---

## Timed mode trigger behavior

Each timed trigger key can use one of these modes:

### On press
The timed state starts only when the key is pressed.

**Example:**  
Press attack once → HUD appears briefly → then hides again

---

### While held
The timed state keeps refreshing while the key is held.

**Example:**  
Hold aim button → timer keeps refreshing as long as the button is held

---

### Press + hold
The timed state starts on press and also keeps refreshing while the key remains held.

**Example:**  
Press and keep holding a gamepad trigger → HUD stays visible longer and only hides after release + delay

---

## Understanding how timed mode actually works

This part is very important.

ShaderToggler does **not** “show” or “hide” HUD elements directly in the usual sense.  
It only controls whether the selected game shaders are **allowed to render** or **blocked**.

So for a hunted HUD group:

- **Group ACTIVE** = selected shaders are blocked = HUD hidden  
- **Group INACTIVE** = selected shaders are allowed = HUD visible  

Because of that, timed mode may appear inverted at first depending on how your group is set up.

---

## Normal auto-hide mode

### Behavior
When triggered:
- the group temporarily becomes **active**
- after the timer ends, it returns to **inactive**

This is useful when:
- **active = hidden** is **not** what you want for the resting state
- or when the group should only block something briefly

**Example:**
- HUD is visible
- press trigger
- HUD disappears
- after delay, HUD returns

This means your group is behaving like a temporary **hide group**.

---

## Inverted auto-hide behavior

### Behavior
When triggered:
- the group temporarily becomes **inactive**
- after the timer ends, it returns to **active**

This is the most useful mode for modern auto-hide HUD behavior.

### Typical setup
For a HUD hide group:
- hunt the HUD shaders normally
- confirm that **group active = HUD hidden**
- enable:
  - **Active at startup**
  - **Auto-hide mode**
  - **Invert auto-hide behavior**

### Result
- game starts → group is active → HUD hidden
- press trigger → group turns inactive temporarily → HUD appears
- timer ends → group turns active again → HUD hides

---

## Practical timed mode examples

### Example 1: Modern auto-hide HUD
Goal:
- HUD hidden by default
- attack input reveals HUD briefly
- HUD hides again after a delay

Setup:
- hunt HUD shaders
- make sure **group active = HUD hidden**
- enable **Active at startup**
- enable **Auto-hide mode**
- enable **Invert auto-hide behavior**
- add attack key as timed trigger
- choose delay, for example `1500 ms`

Result:
- HUD hidden normally
- press attack → HUD appears
- after 1.5 seconds → HUD disappears again

---

### Example 2: Mouse and controller support together
Goal:
- show the HUD whether the player uses mouse or controller

Setup:
- same as above
- add multiple timed triggers:
  - `Left Mouse Button`
  - `Gamepad RT`

Result:
- either trigger reveals the HUD
- timer refreshes when either input is used

---

### Example 3: Keep HUD visible during continuous combat
Goal:
- HUD stays visible while continuously attacking

Setup:
- use **While held** or **Press + hold** for the trigger
- set a short delay, for example `500 ms`

Result:
- repeated or held input keeps the HUD visible
- once input stops, HUD hides after the delay

---

### Example 4: Temporary tooltip / pickup prompt suppression
Goal:
- briefly hide a specific overlay when a key is pressed

Setup:
- group represents the overlay you want to suppress
- use **normal timed mode**
- do **not** invert it

Result:
- press trigger → overlay disappears briefly
- after the timer ends → overlay returns

---

## Timed mode options explained

### Hide delay / show time
This is the main timed duration.

- in normal timed mode: how long the group stays temporarily **active**
- in inverted timed mode: how long the group stays temporarily **inactive**

For HUD auto-show behavior, this is effectively **how long the HUD stays visible**.

---

### Minimum visible time
Prevents the temporary timed state from ending too quickly.

This is useful when:
- fast taps would otherwise make the HUD flash too briefly
- you want a more readable UI reveal

**Example:**  
You tap attack very quickly, but still want the HUD to remain visible for at least `300 ms`.

---

### Fade-out linger
This is **not a real visual fade**.  
It is simply an additional linger stage before the group returns to its resting state.

It helps make the transition feel less abrupt in timing, but it does **not** animate alpha or transparency.

---

## Important limitation (Why no real fade-out?)

A real **visual fade-out is NOT possible** with ShaderToggler.

**Reason:**
- ShaderToggler works by **blocking draw calls at the pipeline level**
- When a shader is disabled, it is **not rendered at all**
- There is **no access to opacity, blending, or animation states**

So the system can only do:
- **Fully visible** (draw call allowed)
- **Fully hidden** (draw call blocked)

It cannot:
- interpolate alpha
- animate transitions
- gradually fade elements

A real fade-out would require:
- modifying shader code
- injecting custom blending logic
- or post-processing those exact UI elements

Which is outside the scope of this add-on.

### What “Fade-out linger” actually means
It does **not** fade the image visually.  
It only adds a short extra timed phase before returning to the resting state.

So it behaves more like:
- visible
- linger a bit longer
- hidden

Not:
- 100% opacity
- 75%
- 50%
- 25%
- 0%

## Marking shaders

To mark shaders successfully, make sure the element you want to hide is currently visible, for example:
- HUD elements  
- menus  
- overlays  
- visual effects  

Then click **Hunt Shaders** on the group you want to configure.

This starts the shader hunting phase for that group.

During this phase, ShaderToggler shows an overlay at the top of the screen with shader information.  
The overlay opacity can be adjusted in the settings, including setting it to **fully invisible** if needed.

Before browsing shaders, the add-on first collects active shaders for a configurable number of frames.  
This reduces the number of shaders you have to go through and makes hunting more practical.

---

## Shader hunting hotkeys

### Pixel shaders
- `Numpad 1` = previous pixel shader  
- `Numpad 2` = next pixel shader  
- `Numpad 3` = mark / unmark current pixel shader  

### Vertex shaders
- `Numpad 4` = previous vertex shader  
- `Numpad 5` = next vertex shader  
- `Numpad 6` = mark / unmark current vertex shader  

### Compute shaders
- `Numpad 7` = previous compute shader  
- `Numpad 8` = next compute shader  
- `Numpad 9` = mark / unmark current compute shader  

### Marked shader browsing
- `Ctrl + Numpad 1 / 2` = previous / next marked pixel shader  
- `Ctrl + Numpad 4 / 5` = previous / next marked vertex shader  
- `Ctrl + Numpad 7 / 8` = previous / next marked compute shader  

### Accelerated holding
Holding down browsing keys will automatically speed up scrolling over time.

---

## Testing a group

To test a group while hunting:
- press the hotkey assigned to that group  

If the selected shaders are correct, the targeted game elements should disappear when the group is active.

When a group is active, the UI shows it as **active**.

When you are finished hunting shaders for a group, click **Done**.

---

## Saving your groups

To keep your groups for the next session, click:

- **Save all Toggle Groups**

This writes the configuration to:

`ShaderToggler.ini`

The file is stored in the same folder as the add-on.

---

## Notes

- ShaderToggler Advanced is for **game shader toggling**, not ReShade effect toggling  
- The UI has been modernized while keeping the original workflow familiar  
- Controller button mapping support is available  
- Timed mode now supports inverted behavior for more intuitive HUD auto-show setups  
- Multiple timed trigger keys let one group react to keyboard, mouse, and controller input at the same time
